# ld32
CompSoc's game for Ludum Dare 32!

See [here](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Setting-up-your-Development-Environment-%28Eclipse%2C-Intellij-IDEA%2C-NetBeans%29) for help getting started.

## Brainstorming
### Tower Defense
Themes:

- Pong / ball is a weapon
- Nuclear / radiation / mutation

Ball has interactions with world objects, positive and negative

"It's Tower Defense, but with an optional extra real-time reaction element"
